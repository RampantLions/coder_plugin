# Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `coder_plugin` for local development.
Please note this documentation assumes you already have `uv` and `Git` installed and ready to go.

1. Fork the `coder_plugin` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
cd <directory_in_which_repo_should_be_created>
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/coder_plugin.git
```

3. Now we need to install the environment. Navigate into the directory

```bash
cd coder_plugin
```

Then, install and activate the environment with:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Install pre-commit to run linters/formatters at commit time:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

5. Create a branch for local development:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Don't forget to add test cases for your added functionality to the `tests` directory.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the formatting tests.

```bash
make check
```

Now, validate that all unit tests are passing:

```bash
make test
```

9. Before raising a pull request you should also run tox.
   This will run the tests across different versions of Python:

```bash
tox
```

This requires you to have multiple versions of python installed.
This step is also triggered in the CI/CD pipeline, so you could also choose to skip this step locally.

10. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

11. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

# Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
   Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in `README.md`.

# Contributing to Zircon

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.
When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

## Code
- Zircon is written in Kotlin but you can add your contribution using *Java*
- If you contribute *Java* code put it into `src/main/java`. If you kontribute Kotlin code it should go into `src/main/kotlin`
- If you write implementation code for something put it into the `org.hexworks.zircon.internal` package
  Conversely interfaces and code which expresses an external api should go to the `org.hexworks.zircon.api` package
- If you add implementation code try to follow [the design philosophy behind Zircon](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/wiki/The-design-philosophy-behind-Zircon)
- Make sure that you add unit tests for your code and
- Check whether the build passes when creating a pull request

## Submitting a PR
- For every PR there should be an accompanying issue which the PR solves
- The PR itself should only contain code which is the solution for the given issue
- If you are a first time contributor check if there is a [suitable issue](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for you
